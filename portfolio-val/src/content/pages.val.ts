Relevio also integrates with external systems such as Algolia, Resend, NHI, FHI, YouTube and Clerk. The solution runs in and uses Google Cloud solutions such as Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage and Artifact Registry.\n \nI had worked with the project both as part of my bachelor's thesis in 2022 and then as a part-time developer hired out as a consultant from Kantega alongside my studies. I assisted with both frontend and backend development, as well as setup in Google Cloud. I also helped build the system from scratch, and has therefore acquired unique experience in setting up a large and complex system.",
